VectorBlox MXP
================

The VectorBlox MXP Matrix Processor is an FPGA-based soft processor
capable of highly parallel execution. Programmed entirely in C/C++,
the MXP is capable of executing data-parallel software algorithms at
hardware-like speeds. MXP's parameterrized design lets the user specify
the amount of parallelism required, ranging from 1 to 128 or more
parallel ALUs. Key features of the MXP include a parallel-access
scratchpad memory to hold vector data and a high-throughput DMA
engine.

VectorBlox Computing licenses the MXP processor as a synthesizable IP
core for use in FPGA designs.

This preview release is for evaluation only, and consists of:

- Pre-built bitstreams to evaluate the MXP processor on several popular
  Altera and Xilinx FPGA development boards
- The MXP Software Development Kit (SDK)
- Example programs
- Documentation

To get started immediately:

- Ensure you have one of the [supported development
  boards](./mxp_supported_boards.html).
